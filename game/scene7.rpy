    "A chill runs through as the room has gotten noticeably darker. 
    Those going to get murdered vibes you had earlier are returning … quickly."

    "Voices start to come from the walls, lights flicker, you almost expect ghosts to start 
    popping out but instead the walls themselves feel almost alive."

    mystery "Are you ready to find the answers you seek?"

    you "!!!"

    reaper "That wasn't a good noise."

    siren "Yea, no shit. Sounds like we’re all stuck here."

    you "Nope, not worth anymore."

    "You spin around and try yanking it open, it feels as though the door’s 
    being tied together from the outside and getting stronger as you pull."

    menu:
        "'Yup, this is it. I die here.":
            "You sit down on the floor in defeat and stare at the door."
            siren "Well [they] officially lost it."
        "Continue banging on the door.":
            "You continue but to no avail."
            "The door’s slowly start feeling more and more like an immovable wall being glued together."
        "Pull out your cell phone.":
            "You go to try and call for help but realize you’re in the most backwater, 
            isolated, no one will ever find my body, part of town."
            "Of course there's no reception."
    reaper "Is this how most competitions are run? Where’s the person 
    who’s going to give me my greatest desire?"

    mystery "Since you asked, please don’t forget the goal of this competition is for you to find that out."

    mystery "If you are all now ready to hear the rules, I bet you would all love to get started."

    "You look around trying to pinpoint where this voice could be coming from but you have no clue, 
    so instead you start looking around at the other two people trapped in the room."

    siren "Hell yeah!"

    "She looks almost bursting with excitement. 
    Like someone who’s about to watch their favorite show's new season."

    reaper "Ready."

    "He looks confused as to where the voices are coming from too but has just 
    chosen to smile straight ahead as though they’re standing right infront of him."

    you "Please get on with it." 

    mystery "Glady! The only way to make sure you all have a fair shot at guessing who the host is, 
    is by making things a little interesting with trials you also have to complete."

    mystery "There will be a total of three trials, each one will lead to you all 
    learning things about yourself and each other."

    mystery "It is important that you learn about each other through these and so there will be trials where teamwork is imperative."

    mystery "You will only be allowed to work in pairs of two and no more."

    mystery "Whoever can find the host by 11pm on Halloween night will get whatever their heart desires, as promised."

    mystery "The first trial will start in 1 hour upstairs, at the first door on the left. Discuss who will be partners amongst the four of you."

    "You start to sweat wondering if you will be the one left out during these trials."

    "{i}Pairs of two? Is that to get someone eliminated? Can you be eliminated? Four of us?{/i}"

    "You look around trying to find this mysterious fourth person while also trying to figure out who you could team up with."
