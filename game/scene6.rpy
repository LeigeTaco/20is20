    "Stepping past the threshold and into the mansion, you couldn’t help but 
    gasp at the state of the foyer before you."

    "Despite the state of its outside, the inside itself was well-maintained."

    "The floorboards, while worn, were swept and washed. 
    No cobwebs decorated the corners of the walls, or the banister."

    "With each further step you take, the situation becomes stranger. 
    Each step, with its matching echo down the halls, reveals more questions."

    "Who lived here? Why would they even bother with maintaining a place of this size?"

    "Why stick with this whole haunted-looking mansion schtick?"

    "As your thoughts drift, your new… companion… lets out a low whistle."

    reaper "Pretty impressive…"

    "Despite the deadpan expression, there’s a glint of wonder to his voice. 
    His eyes drift the same way yours had."

    "At least, they do until they meet yours."

    reaper "Like, this place I mean. It’s impressive, yeah?"

    you "It’s ..."

    "Impressive":
        "You can’t help but agree with him."
        you "I can’t believe how good it looks. It’s clearly been here a while."
        mystery "'A while' may be underselling it."
        mystery "It’s {i}practically prehistoric{/i}."
    "Overwhelming": 
        you "Huge."
        you "Like, I don’t remember the last time I’ve set foot in a place this big you know?"
        reaper "I mean, yeah it’s big, but…"
        "He shrugs at you, before saying"
        reaper "... in the end, the folks who live here are probably the same as anyone else."
        reaper "Folks are all the same in the end, no matter what."
        mystery "Woooow. From anyone else, that would have sounded edgy."
    "A Dump":
        you "It needs a lot of work."
        you "Like sure, the location’s great and the owner is trying hard, 
        but this place has to be filled with I don’t know."
        you "Asbestos or something?"
        "As your new companion stares at you confused, a laugh like clear and charming bells could be heard."
        mystery "Asbestos? You’re invited to someone’s home, and you say it’s filled with asbestos?"

"That voice grabs hold of your mind, catches your words in your mouth before you can say them."

"There’s a sense of familiarity, a feeling of nostalgia…"

you "... [siren]?"

"Sure enough, as soon as her name passed your lips she stepped forward."

"Out of the shadows of this mysterious mansion came your childhood friend."

"For a moment, you find yourself wondering if this was reality."

you "I’m not losing it, am I?"

"As if to assuage your fears, [siren] laughed in that pitchy way you knew her for."

siren "I’d be surprised if you hadn't lost it a while ago."

you "[siren] what? What are you doing here? I- "

"She looks away from you, and scoffs."

siren "Isn’t it obvious? I’m here to win."

"Once her eyes fell on Reaper she paused, gazed up and down, and then said with a nonchalant smile."

siren "I see the competition is… strong."
